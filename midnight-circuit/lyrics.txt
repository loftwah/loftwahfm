[Intro – 4 bars]
Mmm… we rollin’ slow tonight
Underneath them city lights
Every shadow feels just right
This our lane, this our life

[Chorus – 8 bars, smooth & melodic]
We roll slow… down the boulevard
Crew so tight… and we livin’ large
Smoke drift high… when the beat drop hard
Midnight circuit… yeah, that’s our yard
We roll slow… down the boulevard
Crew so tight… and we livin’ large
Smoke drift high… when the beat drop hard
Midnight circuit… yeah, that’s our yard

[Verse 1 – 8 bars, half-sung groove]
Chrome on shine, bassline hummin’ low
Eyes half-closed but my mind still knows
Every turn I take’s like a mark I claim
Every street I ride know the crew by name
Windows down, let the cool air slide
Old tape deck bring the old school vibe
One hand on the wheel, other holdin’ my drink
Every block we hit got the world in sync

[Pre-Chorus – 4 bars]
No rush, no fear, just a steady flow
Every light we pass got a golden glow

[Chorus – 8 bars]
We roll slow… down the boulevard
Crew so tight… and we livin’ large
Smoke drift high… when the beat drop hard
Midnight circuit… yeah, that’s our yard
We roll slow… down the boulevard
Crew so tight… and we livin’ large
Smoke drift high… when the beat drop hard
Midnight circuit… yeah, that’s our yard

[Verse 2 – 8 bars]
Low seat lean while the moon rides high
Heat close by just to keep that tie
Every story told got a twist, got a win
Every lane we cross feel like home again
Gold paint shine under night parade
Every move made in the cuts we played
No rush in my step, just a calm in my soul
Every ride we take make the night feel whole

[Bridge – 8 bars, smooth harmonies]
Slow burn… let the night run free
Every turn… keep it close to me
This our lane, and we won’t let go
Midnight groove in the lights that glow

[Chorus – 8 bars, last round with ad-libs]
We roll slow… down the boulevard (yeah, we rollin’)
Crew so tight… and we livin’ large (stay shinin’)
Smoke drift high… when the beat drop hard (keep ridin’)
Midnight circuit… yeah, that’s our yard (that’s our yard)
We roll slow… down the boulevard (ooh-oooh)
Crew so tight… and we livin’ large (stay shinin’)
Smoke drift high… when the beat drop hard (keep ridin’)
Midnight circuit… yeah, that’s our yard (our yard)

[Outro – 4 bars, hummed melody]
Mmm… we rollin’ slow tonight
Underneath them city lights
