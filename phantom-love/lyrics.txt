[Intro — 4 lines]
I still feel you in the dark, your shadow draws me near
A whisper splits the silence, it’s all I seem to hear
The air is cold, the night is still, I won’t turn away
Memory wraps my soul like chains I cannot break today

[Verse — 8 lines]
In the silence of my room, your whisper cuts like steel
A ghost in every corner, a wound that will not close
Rain on the window keeps time with all the love we lost
I reach into the darkness, but you never answer back
The moonlight makes your outline, a trick my aching mind
I chase the shape and stumble, with nothing left to find
I’m locked inside your memory, a room without a key
The part of me you carried still holds the rest of me

[Chorus]
I’m chasing shadows in the night, your ghost is tearing me apart
I call your name into the void, a phantom beating in my heart
The love I want is out of reach, a scar that will not heal
I’m lost inside this endless dream, and nothing is ever real

[Bridge — 4 lines]
I know I should release you, let the night reclaim your name
But my heart keeps its vigil, holding candles to the flame
I’m drowning in the wanting, with nowhere left to go
I’m reaching for an answer only silence seems to know

[Chorus — final]
I’m chasing shadows in the night, your ghost is tearing me apart
I call your name into the void, a phantom beating in my heart
The love I want is out of reach, a scar that will not heal
I’m lost inside this endless dream, and nothing is ever real

[Outro — 2 lines]
You fade with the horizon as the first cold light appears
I leave the door behind me, but I still can’t leave the years
