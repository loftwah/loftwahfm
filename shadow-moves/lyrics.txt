[Intro – 8 bars]
Lights out… watch close…
Every step’s a ghost…
You can feel me in the room…
But you’ll never see me move…

[Chorus – 8 bars]
Shadow moves, they can’t find me
Cold eyes burnin’ deep inside me
Step close, feel the weight, it’s heavy
One touch, and the night turns deadly
Shadow moves, they can’t find me
Cold eyes burnin’ deep inside me
Step close, feel the weight, it’s heavy
One touch, and the night turns deadly

[Verse 1 – 16 bars]
I don’t talk much, I just show up
Every door locked, still I roll up
Every plan made, I control that
Every loose end, yeah, I fold that
Watch the floor shake when I come through
Eyes all wide, they don’t know who
Every step’s placed like a chess move
Every breath timed, that’s the best proof
Never too loud, but they all hear
Never too close, but I’m still near
No crown, still I run this
No heat shown, but I sun this
Time’s on my side, I don’t hurry
Calm in the storm, I don’t worry
Every hand played, I’m the dealer
Every last word — straight killer

[Chorus – 8 bars]
Shadow moves, they can’t find me
Cold eyes burnin’ deep inside me
Step close, feel the weight, it’s heavy
One touch, and the night turns deadly
Shadow moves, they can’t find me
Cold eyes burnin’ deep inside me
Step close, feel the weight, it’s heavy
One touch, and the night turns deadly

[Verse 2 – 8 bars]
Low tone voice when I speak out
Name so known they don’t freak out
Ice in my veins when I’m walkin’
Don’t need to shout, they know I’m talkin’
Every dark lane, I been down it
If there’s a king here, I just crown it
One glance given, that’s enough said
Already played out what’s up ahead

[Chorus – 8 bars]
Shadow moves, they can’t find me
Cold eyes burnin’ deep inside me
Step close, feel the weight, it’s heavy
One touch, and the night turns deadly
Shadow moves, they can’t find me
Cold eyes burnin’ deep inside me
Step close, feel the weight, it’s heavy
One touch, and the night turns deadly

[Bridge – 8 bars]
No light, still I see clear
No fight, still they feel fear
One mark, then I disappear
One spark, and I’m right here
Slow burn in the dead night
Cold turn when I catch sight
No sound, but you feel me near
Step wrong — and I’m in your ear

[Chorus – 8 bars]
Shadow moves, they can’t find me
Cold eyes burnin’ deep inside me
Step close, feel the weight, it’s heavy
One touch, and the night turns deadly
Shadow moves, they can’t find me
Cold eyes burnin’ deep inside me
Step close, feel the weight, it’s heavy
One touch, and the night turns deadly

[Outro – 8 bars]
Lights out… watch close…
Every step’s a ghost…
You can feel me in the room…
But you’ll never see me move…
