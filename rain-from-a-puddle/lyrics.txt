[Intro]
Ohhh… made it through the dark
Now we’re dancing in the light

[Chorus]
Dancing in the light
Made it through the tunnel
Splashing into life
Bringing rain from a puddle
Dancing in the light
Made it through the tunnel
Splashing into life
Bringing rain from a puddle

[Verse 1]
I was lost for a long time, shadows in my way
But I kept on moving, made it to the day
Every tear, every heartbreak, taught me how to shine
Now the sun is on my face and the road is mine
I can feel the colours burning through the grey
Every little heartbeat telling me to stay
Holding on to hope, yeah, I found my way
Now I’m standing in the light and I’m here to say…

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
From the quiet nights to the ocean air
I can feel the freedom, nothing can compare
Every laugh with my friends, every song we sing
Brings me back to life, yeah, it’s everything
And my little girl’s smile is the brightest light
Keeps me warm through the cold, every single night
Every dream that I hold, I will see it through
From this moment on, it’s all something new

[Bridge]
I walked the long road, but I made it here
Every step through the pain brought me clear
Now the clouds fade away, I can finally see
This is my time, it’s where I’m meant to be

[Chorus]
Dancing in the light
Made it through the tunnel
Splashing into life
Bringing rain from a puddle
Dancing in the light
Made it through the tunnel
Splashing into life
Bringing rain from a puddle
